                Hello! My name is Jacob Yaw and I am an aspiring software engineer currently enrolled in <a href = "https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a> with the intention of making my aspirations a reality! This
                website was created to demonstrate some of the skills I have already learned thus far in the curriculum as well as show off one of my intrests...<i class=italics>orchids</i>!
                <br>
                <br>
                I've had a very keen interest in flowers and plants for <i>literally</i> my entire life. My childhood backyard was full of many different types of plants that had grown and spread wildly by the time I was born.
                For that reason, I spent a lot of time outside and loved watching everything flourish throughout the varying seasons, from short-lived spring tulips to hardy fall mums! I have a fond memory of going to the <a href = "https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/" target="-blank">Missouri Botanical Garden</a> 
                to see their annual orchid show in march. The flowers had such a vast array of colors and patterns and shapes-there were so many different kinds!
                <br>
                <br>
                Here's a few that I found pretty memorable.
